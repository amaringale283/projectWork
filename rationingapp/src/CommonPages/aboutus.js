                    The Public Distribution System (PDS) evolved as a system of management of scarcity through distribution 
                    of foodgrains at affordable prices. Over the years, PDS has become an important part of Governmentâ€™s 
                    policy for management of food economy in the country. PDS is supplemental in nature and is not intended 
                    to make available the entire requirement of any of the commodities distributed under it to a household or
                    a section of the society. PDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT 
                    Governments. The Central Government, through Food Corporation of India (FCI), has assumed the responsibility
                    for procurement, storage, transportation and bulk allocation of food grains to the State Governments. The 
                    operational responsibility including allocation within State, identification of eligible families, issue 
                    of Ration Cards and supervision of the functioning of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) etc., rest with the State 
                    Governments. Under the PDS, presently the commodities namely wheat, rice, sugar and kerosene are being 
                    allocated to the States/UTs for distribution. Some States/UTs also distribute additional items of mass 
                    consumption through the PDS outlets such as pulses, edible oils, iodized salt, spices, etc.
